## Overall Learning 

During my internship, uring my internship, I worked on multiple Java mini projects such as a Calculator Application, Movie Booking System, Tic Tac Toe Game, and Library Management System. These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts, control structures, and logical problem-solving.

I also completed a final project — Food Delivery Application using Spring Boot, where I gained hands-on experience in developing RESTful APIs, applying layered architecture, and integrating the application with a database.

Overall, the internship improved my technical skills, debugging ability, and understanding of real-world backend application development.

<!-- Project 1 -->
[<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Food Delivery Application</h3>
<p>
  This project involved the design and development of a backend-based Food Delivery Application using Java and Spring Boot.
  The system provides RESTful APIs for user registration and authentication, restaurant and menu management, order placement,
  payment processing, delivery tracking, and customer reviews. The application implements JWT-based authentication,
  role-based access control, and database integration using MySQL and Spring Data JPA.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

During the internship period, I participated in Life Skill Training (LST) sessions conducted on alternate Sundays and Soft Skill Training (SST) sessions conducted for a total duration of 15 days.

The Life Skill Training (LST) sessions focused on personal development topics such as self-awareness, discipline, decision-making, time management, and goal setting. These sessions helped improve my mindset, learning habits, and overall approach toward personal and professional growth.

The Soft Skill Training (SST) sessions focused on enhancing communication skills, confidence building, teamwork, professional behavior, and workplace etiquette. The 15-day training provided structured exposure to developing interpersonal and professional skills essential for career readiness.

Overall, both LST and SST sessions played a significant role in strengthening my personal, social, and professional skills alongside technical learning.
